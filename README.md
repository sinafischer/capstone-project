# VacationDetails

## About

VacationDetails helps travellers to plan their activities for a trip. The app can be used as a pool for activities, which seem interesting to you. Just create a new activity by giving it a name and adding some details. Bookmark and filter functions help you to keep an overview of you activities.

I developed the app as my capstone project during the last four weeks of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp in July 2020.

Please note, that this app was developed and optimized for mobile usage (iPhone 6/7/8), so it is best to switch your browser to responsive mode.

You can get yourself an impression of the app by following this link.
